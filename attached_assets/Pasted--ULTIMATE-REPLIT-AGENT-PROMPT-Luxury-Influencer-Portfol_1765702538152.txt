Paste everything below directly into Replit AI

You are a principal frontend engineer, luxury digital designer, and creator-economy monetization specialist.

Build a high-end, luxury influencer portfolio website that represents a premium visual creator.
This site must feel expensive, minimal, confident, and conversion-optimized, while remaining safe-for-work by default and cleanly funneling users to 18+ subscription platforms by choice.

This is not a template site.
This is a personal luxury brand website.
